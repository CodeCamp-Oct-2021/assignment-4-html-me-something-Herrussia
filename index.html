            <h2>Bees, Bees, Bees (&& my eccentricities)!</h2>
            <p>
               I enjoy cultivating new plants and supporting bee populations near my home with a variety of wildflowers, fruits, and vegetables!<br>
               This has led to some particularly wonderful encounters with a multitude of bees that feel comfortable visiting my home!<br><br>

               <img src="bee3.jpg" alt="Bee3" width="300" height="300"><br><br>
               I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to befriend such gentle creatures and have them feel comfortable enough to interact with me!

               I was graciously bestowed the opportunity to be a dog person!<br>
               Heffie is a beautifully kind soul with so much love and expression. He keeps me on my toes and puts up with my constant shenannigans.<br>
               I genuinely feel like the luckiest person to share such an amazing pup with my best friend!<br><br>

            <p>
               I spend an ungodly amount of money on coffee, but at least I know what I like!<br>
                Picasso's Coffee is my absolute favorite and as such has become an almost ritualistic part of my life!<br><br>

                However, I also really enjoy reading new books and obsessing over new pastry recpies to try!<br>
                A crowd favorite pastry being fresh made crepes with lemon curd! However, I could also be convinced to make chocolate croissants for anyone who may be interested!<br><br>
